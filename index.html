    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hey! My name is Brody Haar (<em>AKA Drogba</em>) and I'm a runner native to Phoenix, Arizona. <br /> <br /> I am currently a sophomore running for Vanderbilt University's NCAA D1 SEC Cross Country team in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>
    <a href="https://vucommodores.com/roster/brody-haar/" target="_blank"><img src="https://vucommodores.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Haar-Brody_KMS09693-scaled-e1664462378540-420x640.jpg" alt="Roster Photo" height="600px" width="400px"/></a>
    <h3>How I Started Running</h3>
    <p>In the spring of my seventh-grade year, the commencement of my soccer season marked a significant milestone.</p>  
    <p>From an early age of two, I embarked on a soccer journey that, while not positioning me as an exceptional player, instilled in me an unwavering passion for this exhilarating sport. Participating in a recreational league, I found immense pleasure in my dual roles as Right Forward and Goalie. Whenever I stumbled, I promptly regained my footing, occasionally even executing impromptu somersaults while in full sprint. These youthful acrobatics became a cherished aspect of my soccer experience. Anticipating the onset of a fresh season, I brimmed with anticipation, prepared to thwart every adversary's attempt at scoring.</p>
      <p>To my surprise, my coach decided to assign me to a previously unexplored position - Right Back. Recognizing my exceptional speed among my teammates, his rationale initially eluded me. However, I soon discovered that my ability to swiftly retrieve the ball and propel it across the field rendered me an adept defender in his estimation. After the final game of the season, as I bid my teammates farewell and made my way homeward, Coach Guyll approached me unexpectedly. Uncertain of his intent - whether it be a reprimand or commendation for my efforts - I awaited his words with trepidation. It transpired that he was recruiting me for the sport of Cross Country.</p>
      <p>He proceeded to expound upon the essence of Cross Country, emphasizing the significance of maintaining a consistent pace in long-distance races. Citing my physical attributes and commendable endurance, he posited that I possessed the potential for running success. That night, I resolved that come the fall of my eighth-grade year, I would join the Cross Country team under Coach Guyll's tutelage. The subsequent months saw me exerting great effort, diligently training, and managing to trim nearly three minutes off my previous 1.5-mile race time. Such a remarkable improvement within a single year of running evoked a profound sense of accomplishment, which my grandparents eagerly reinforced by sharing videos showcasing my strides.</p>
      <p>During my third meet, I experienced a transformative realization. Running began to evoke a sense of joy, transcending its function as a means to clear my mind. I became attuned to the taste of crisp, invigorating air dancing upon my palate, and I keenly felt the rhythmic inhalation and exhalation of oxygen fueling my lungs. Releasing that final breath with a triumphant exultation, I reveled in the scent of freshly mown grass. Regrettably, my enjoyment was tempered by my unfortunate allergy to grass. Ultimately, I made the decision to redirect my focus away from soccer and commit myself wholeheartedly to year-round running as a member of the prestigious Brophy College Preparatory Cross Country team.</p>
      <p>The grueling nature of Cross Country races may evoke moments of torment, yet the ultimate reward far outweighs any temporary discomfort. It is astounding to contemplate how a single conversation with my soccer coach could yield such transformative effects. I am profoundly grateful for my receptivity to personal growth, for without it, I would likely not find myself on this current path of running excellence.</p>
    <h4>Most Inspirational as a Junior</h4>
    <blockquote>Each year, we recognize one Brophy runner as our most inspirational. This award is in
recognition of Steve Manos, our all-time most inspirational runner. Steve passed away in 2008
after a 10-month battle with cancer. Steve was not one of our fastest runners when he first
started at Brophy, but by the time he finished, he was a top-20 runner at the state meet. He
improved every single year he ran, and this led him to run in college at Seattle University. At
Seattle U., Steve set four different school records, was named their Student Athlete of the year,
and was even named an NCAA Academic All-American. When he died, he was on his way to
earning a PhD in Economics. Steve once said, “It’s the ultimate test of the human spirit to see
who can find the most in them to keep going, even when you’re hurting. You don’t want to finish
the race and realize, ‘Man, I could have gone a little bit harder or a little bit faster.’ You want to
finish the race and feel like you gave it all you had.” He will forever be an inspiration to me and
everyone else who has known him. <br /><br />
Brody Haar is the recipient of our Steve Manos Most Inspirational Award this year. Brody is a
junior and has a goal next year of winning the state meet again. No one would have predicted
that his freshman year. Much like Steve, Brody was not one of our fastest runners when he
started cross country as a freshman. It wasn’t until the summer after his freshman year that he
made the jump towards greatness. He inspired us all his sophomore year by coming back from
his summer break a changed runner. Over that summer, Brody dedicated himself to running. He
ran the entire summer in the high elevation of Flagstaff, and from that moment on, he’s been
one of our best. <br /><br />
In addition to his continuous improvement, Brody is an inspiration to all our young runners. It’s
very common that some of our freshmen this year would tell me, “I saw Brody running this
weekend.” This was told to me on more than one occasion, and it’s especially noteworthy
because all of the students who had Brody sightings live quite far from each other.
Brody will continue to inspire the team next year as our returning number one runner. This year
at state, he ran a 16:16. He finished 17th overall while helping to lead us to our first
championship in 17 years. Congratulations, Brody, on this award. You are an inspiration to us
all. Though I couldn’t have imagined it his freshman year, I wouldn’t bet against Brody in his
quest to be the fastest runner in the state of Arizona next year.</blockquote>
